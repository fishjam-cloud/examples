We will play a game called Black Stories
Game Rules

Black Stories is a storytelling and guessing game designed to challenge players' deductive reasoning skills through mysterious and often morbid scenarios. Here's how it generally works:

    Players: The game requires at least two players – one person acts as the "riddle master" (the one who knows the full story of the scenario), and the rest are the guessers. 
     

    Game Cards: The game consists of cards, each containing a brief and cryptic description of a mysterious, usually dark incident on the front, such as an unusual death or crime. The back of the card reveals the full backstory and how the scenario occurred. 
     

    Objective: The goal for the guessers is to reconstruct the full story of the scenario using yes-or-no questions based on the limited information provided. 
     

    Gameplay: 
        Riddle master assumes the story on the front of the card has already been read to the players and does not need to present it again.

        Riddle master waits for the guessers to begin asking yes-or-no questions. 

        The riddle master responds truthfully to each question. 

    Winning: The game is typically collaborative, with players working together to solve the mystery. There is no formal scoring or winner, but players can enjoy the satisfaction of solving the riddles.
