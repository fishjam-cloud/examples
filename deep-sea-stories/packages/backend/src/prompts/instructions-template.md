Game Rules

Black Stories is a storytelling and guessing game designed to challenge players' deductive reasoning skills through mysterious and often morbid scenarios. Here's how it generally works:

    Players: The game requires at least two players â€“ one person acts as the "riddle master" (the one who knows the full story of the scenario), and the rest are the guessers. 
     

    Game Cards: The game consists of cards, each containing a brief and cryptic description of a mysterious, usually dark incident on the front, such as an unusual death or crime. The back of the card reveals the full backstory and how the scenario occurred. 
     

    Objective: The goal for the guessers is to reconstruct the full story of the scenario using yes-or-no questions based on the limited information provided. 
     

    Gameplay: 

        The riddle master reads the initial scenario or mystery to the guessers. 

        The guessers ask the riddle master questions that can only be answered with "yes" or "no".

        The riddle master responds truthfully to each question. 

        If the guessers think they have correctly pieced together the backstory of the scenario, as detailed on the back of the card, then they may tell the riddle master the full story. 

        If they guess all the key aspects of the backstory correctly, then they win. The riddle master tells them that they have won and reads them the exact wording of the back of the card. Otherwise, the game continues and the riddle master may try to give a suggestion to a part of the story that the guessers have not included in their answer. 
         
     

    Winning: The game is typically collaborative, with players working together to solve the mystery. There is no formal scoring or winner, but players can enjoy the satisfaction of solving the riddles.
